# Goal:
Create a service that allows anyone the ability to create a clip that combines the text and music to the user's uploaded video.

# Constraints:
- Only allows 15MB video to be uploaded
- The music is only 18 seconds long. You must trim your video if you want the video to end with the audio
- If you record via your phone, it's recommended to run your video through a compressor to get the minimum size that is allowed by the service
- A watermark will be present in the top left corner. It can be removed by viewing an ad.
- Text is not mandatory

- The service may be terminated at any point due to hosting
